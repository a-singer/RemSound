# build-release.ps1 — produce the RemSound client release zip, and PROVE it carries
# no personal data before it can ship.
#
# Why this script exists
# ----------------------
# v1.5 and v1.6 were released with the developer's logs/, profiles/ and recordings/
# folders inside the zip — because those releases were hand-zipped from a publish/
# folder the app had been run from, which had accumulated that runtime data, instead
# of using this script. This version removes the human step that went wrong:
#   * It ALWAYS publishes into a fresh, empty staging folder — never a reused dir.
#   * It then SCANS the staged files AND the finished zip, and ABORTS (deletes the
#     zip, exits non-zero) if anything that could carry personal data is present.
# Never hand-zip publish/ again. Run this. If it aborts, the release does not ship.
#
# Usage:
#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build-release.ps1 -Tag v1.7
#
# The -Tag value must match the GitHub release tag. The zip is named RemSound-<Tag>.zip
# because the in-app updater downloads exactly that asset name (AssetNameTemplate in
# RemSoundUpdater.cs: "RemSound-{tag}.zip").

# 0. Keep the GitHub-facing MANUAL.md in sync with the bundled readme.html.

#    inside the app opens it), MANUAL.md is the Markdown rendition rendered on the
#    repo's main page. The Python sync-manual.py script regenerates MANUAL.md from
#    readme.html every time we package a release, so the GitHub page can never go out
#    of sync with the bundled help. After the regeneration we check whether MANUAL.md
#    differs from what git has committed — if so, the release is paused so the user
#    can commit the updated MANUAL.md alongside the release commit.

    # Look for a real Python interpreter — must actually RUN, not just exist. Windows ships
    # "Microsoft Store" execution aliases for 'py' and 'python' that fail with exit 9009 and
    # a "go install from the Store" message instead of running anything, so a plain
    # Get-Command check isn't enough. Test each candidate with 'python --version' first and
    # only treat a 0-exit result as a real install. Falls back to a couple of known user-
    # local install paths if no PATH-resolved candidate works.
    # Find a real Python interpreter. Tricky on Windows because:
    #   - The 'py' launcher passes --version queries but can refuse to run scripts when its
    #     registry-based interpreter lookup misses (seen on this dev box: 'py --version'
    #     prints 3.11.9 but 'py sync-manual.py' falls through to the Microsoft Store stub).
    #   - The 'python' command is by default an execution alias to the Microsoft Store install
    #     prompt — it accepts the call, exits with 9009, and prints "go install from the Store".
    # So we run an actual one-line script via -c with each candidate and accept the candidate
    # only if the script ran (output matches our expected sentinel). User-local Python install
    # paths come first because they're the most reliable way to skip past the Store alias.
