/// A small "Loading audio driver..." window shown on its OWN dedicated UI thread while the
/// main thread builds <see cref="MainForm"/>.
///
/// Why it exists: opening an ASIO driver is slow — 1-3 seconds on many drivers — and that
/// happens synchronously during MainForm construction. Without a splash the user sees
/// nothing, or a blank "Not Responding" window shell, for those seconds, and it looks hung.
///
/// Why a SEPARATE thread: the ASIO driver must keep being opened on the main UI thread —
/// that is the STA, message-pumping thread every ASIO / COM driver is most compatible with,
/// and moving the driver open off it risks breaking drivers we cannot test. But the main
/// thread is therefore blocked for the whole open, so a splash shown on it would itself be
/// frozen. Running the splash on its own STA thread with its own message loop lets it paint
/// and stay alive while the main thread is busy. No ASIO or driver code is touched — only
/// this cosmetic window runs on the side thread.
///
/// Shown only for profiles that actually use an ASIO driver; a WASAPI-only profile builds
/// the main window near-instantly and gets no splash (it would just flash).
