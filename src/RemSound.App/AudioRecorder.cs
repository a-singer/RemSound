/// Background recorder that writes float audio to disk as WAV (custom PCM writer with

/// Concentus.Oggfile), or FLAC (CUETools.Codecs.FLAKE — pure managed lossless).
///
/// Pipeline:
///   1. Sender / receiver audio threads call <see cref="WriteSent"/> /
///      <see cref="WriteReceived"/> — each appends to a pre-allocated lock-free SPSC ring
///      buffer (one per direction) using nothing but a memcpy, an atomic add on the write
///      head, and an event Set. Zero allocations, zero locks, zero signaling primitives
///      that could contend with disk I/O. Audio threads NEVER touch the disk and never
///      touch the file writers.
///   2. A single background writer thread waits on the wake-up event, drains both rings,
///      mixes the two directions when source mode is "Both", and feeds the resulting
///      samples to the format writer.
///   3. <see cref="Stop"/> drains anything still in the rings, closes the file, and
///      signals the caller with the final path and byte count.
///
/// This shape replaced an earlier BlockingCollection + ArrayPool design (2026-05-14)
/// that exhibited intermittent pops under priority mode + recording. The semaphore
/// signaling inside BlockingCollection and the per-call ArrayPool rents were both
/// occasional sources of multi-hundred-microsecond audio-thread spikes; with a
/// 32-sample ASIO buffer (0.67 ms callback budget) that was enough to miss deadlines.
/// The lock-free ring keeps audio-thread work bounded to a handful of nanoseconds.
///
/// "Both" source mode: when both rings have audio, the writer thread drains
/// min(sent_avail, received_avail) frames and sum-mixes them. When only one side has
/// data (e.g. the user has Send Audio off, or no peer is connected), that side is
/// drained solo with the other treated as silence — the recording never stalls because
/// of a quiet direction.
///
/// Channel-mode downmix happens at the writer-thread layer (one place to do it cleanly)
/// rather than at each enqueue point.
///
/// Lifecycle: one AudioRecorder per recording session. The MainForm creates a fresh one
/// on Start and disposes it on Stop. Reconfiguring mid-session is not supported — the user
/// stops, edits settings, and starts again.
