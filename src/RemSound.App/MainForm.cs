    // with four logical sections; status (healthLabel/statusLabel) sits in a footer below the
    // tabs so the user always sees connection health regardless of which tab is active.
    //
    // Navigation (the standard Windows / NVDA-friendly pattern):
    //   * Arrow Left/Right when the tab strip has focus → cycle tabs (NVDA announces each).
    //   * Ctrl+Tab / Ctrl+Shift+Tab from anywhere on the form → cycle tabs.
    //   * Tab key from the strip → focus enters the active page's first control.
    //   * Tab past the last page control → focus moves to the status footer / form chrome.
    //
    // The TabControl is TabIndex=0 + TabStop=true so a fresh Tab from the form's chrome
    // lands on the strip first. We deliberately do NOT auto-focus a control inside the
    // active page on SelectedIndexChanged — that competes with arrow-key navigation (every
    // arrow press would yank focus off the strip into a page control, and the next arrow
    // would go to that control instead of cycling the next tab). Ed reported "bounces
    // about" with the previous always-auto-focus design; removed the handler.

    // auto-jumps the user across tabs.

    // no AccessibleRole, no SelectedIndexChanged hook). Andre's working accessible-readout

    // correctly via the framework's built-in MSAA exposure. Past attempts to "improve" this
    // (custom AccessibleName, dynamic sync on tab change, AccessibleRole.None) all made it
    // worse: extra "main sections", "tab control" double-reads, "pane" prefixes. The
    // standard pattern wins. 2026-05-06.
    // TabControl accessibility: the "tab control" prefix Ed kept hearing is from .NET 10

    // with TabItem children, and NVDA announces both. Microsoft removed the opt-out
    // (Switch.UseLegacyAccessibilityFeatures) for .NET Core / 5+ / 10. Andre's app reads
    // cleanly because it's .NET Framework 4.x where the older WinForms accessibility
    // implementation exposes less detail.
    //

    // AccessibleObject to return a non-Tab role so NVDA reads less context. Risk:
    // dotnet/winforms#11831 throws InvalidOperationException on .NET 8/9 when overriding

    ///      across the last <see cref="LookbackSeconds"/> seconds, so a bad event keeps target
    ///      elevated long enough to cover the long-tail of the same disturbance.
    ///   2. **Cap auto-tune recommendations at <see cref="AutoTuneRecommendationCapMs"/>.** Beyond
    ///      that the user is in "I want a huge buffer for terrible network" territory — they can
    ///      drag the slider there manually; the auto-tuner shouldn't go there on its own.
    ///   3. **Asymmetric step.** Raising the target on observed jitter happens immediately. Lowering
    ///      is rate-limited to <see cref="MaxDecreasePerTickMs"/> per tick so a brief good window
    ///      doesn't undo the protection a bad event just earned us.
