/// Subscribes to Windows' system power-state changes and fires a single callback on
/// <see cref="PowerModes.Resume"/> — i.e. when the system has just come back from sleep
/// (S3) or hibernate (S4). Both states raise the same Resume event, so the one hook covers
/// both. Used by <see cref="MainForm"/> to re-initialise the audio backend after wake:
/// after a sleep cycle the USB audio device (ASIO / WASAPI) can come back in a degraded
/// state where the pipeline appears to run but no sound actually comes out of the
/// interface, and a clean close-and-reopen of the audio backend clears it.
///
/// Threading: PowerModeChanged is raised on a system-message thread, NOT the UI thread.
/// The handler returns from that thread quickly (no work done inline) and schedules the
/// real reset on a background task — which then marshals onto the UI thread via the
/// caller's callback. The caller's callback is responsible for any UI-thread marshaling.
///
/// USB settle delay: Windows raises Resume early, sometimes before USB devices have
/// finished re-enumerating. The handler waits <see cref="SettleDelay"/> before firing the
/// callback so the audio backend re-init has a fully-ready USB stack to talk to.
///
/// Debounce: Windows can in rare cases fire Resume twice in quick succession after a
/// short sleep. The handler ignores Resume events within <see cref="DebounceWindow"/> of
/// the previous one so the audio backend isn't torn down and rebuilt twice for one wake.
