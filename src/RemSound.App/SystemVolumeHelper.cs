/// Thin wrapper around NAudio's <see cref="MMDeviceEnumerator"/> + <see cref="AudioEndpointVolume"/>
/// to drive the Windows master volume on the system's <em>default</em> render device — the same
/// device the system-tray volume slider and the keyboard's volume keys control.
///
/// Why default-render-device specifically (and not e.g. the WASAPI outputs RemSound is currently
/// playing through): in Ed's primary use case the listener machine is using ASIO for RemSound
/// playback, but the Windows default output device is what NVDA + browsers + everything else
/// runs through, and that's the volume Ed wants to nudge. Targeting the default device matches
/// what the user already mentally maps "the system volume" to. ASIO devices don't expose a
/// MasterVolumeLevelScalar via this CoreAudio surface anyway — they have hardware gain — so the
/// "what about ASIO?" question doesn't apply here.
///
/// 2026-05-11 — switched to a cached enumerator/device/endpoint-volume trio (previously each call
/// created and disposed a fresh set). Reason: the system-volume hotkeys now allow Windows-side
/// auto-repeat on hold (see <see cref="RemSound.Core.GlobalHotkey.Register"/>), which can fire
/// the receiver-side handler at ~30 Hz. Each fresh enumeration is multiple COM calls into the
/// Windows audio service; doing that 30 times a second was correlated with receive-side audio
/// glitches in testing logs. Caching collapses every steady-state call to one VolumeStepUp/Down
/// on the cached endpoint-volume. The cache is invalidated on any COM exception so a device
/// hot-swap or audio-service restart self-heals on the next call.
