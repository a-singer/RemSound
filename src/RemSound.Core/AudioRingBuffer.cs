/// Single-producer / single-consumer byte ring buffer for an audio pipeline. Used on both the
/// receive side (network → playout) and the send side (composite mixing across capture backends).
/// Producer thread calls <see cref="Write(ReadOnlySpan{byte})"/>; consumer thread calls
/// <see cref="Read(Span{byte})"/> or <see cref="ReadFloats(Span{float})"/>.
///
/// Design choices for predictability:
///   * Power-of-two capacity for cheap mod via mask.
///   * No locks; head/tail are written by exactly one thread each. Reads of the other side use Volatile.Read
///     to get the latest published value.
///   * On overflow the oldest data is dropped, not silently retained — the playout target is the source of truth.
///   * On underrun the consumer gets silence and an underrun count is incremented.
