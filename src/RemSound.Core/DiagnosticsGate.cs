/// Single shared on/off switch for the engine's diagnostic instrumentation. The App sets
/// <see cref="Enabled"/> at startup from <c>AppConfig.LoggingEnabled</c> and re-sets it
/// whenever the user toggles the <em>Enable logs</em> checkbox in Preferences. Every probe
/// site in <c>RemSound.Sender</c> and <c>RemSound.Receiver</c> reads this flag as its very
/// first action and bails before doing any measurement, CAS update or per-sample arithmetic
/// when it is false.
///
/// What's behind this gate:
/// <list type="bullet">
///   <item>Sender-side max-time probes — <c>SenderLane.OnMixedSamples</c> emit timing,
///         <c>AudioSender.SendToAll</c> kernel-send timing, capture-callback gap timers in
///         <c>AsioCaptureBackend</c> and <c>MixingEngine</c>.</item>
///   <item>Receiver-side max-time probes — <c>NetworkListener</c> dispatch timing,
///         <c>ReceiverDiagnostics</c> arrival-gap and render-callback-gap recording.</item>
///   <item>The per-sample envelope-spike detector
///         (<c>ReceiverDiagnostics.RecordOutputSampleSteps</c>), which iterates every output
///         sample doing second-derivative arithmetic and is the most expensive probe.</item>
/// </list>
///
/// What's <em>not</em> behind this gate: the running counters that feed the always-visible
/// status footer (packets sent, packets received, bytes, underruns, drops). Those are cheap
/// <c>Interlocked.Add</c> calls and the UI needs them whether logs are on or off.
///
/// Flag is plain <c>volatile</c>: the audio path reads it on every callback; lock-free reads
/// are essential, and the only writer is the UI thread on a checkbox-toggle (effectively
/// once per session). The gate flips on or off cleanly without any inflight write needing to
/// see the new value mid-probe.
