    // 2. spikeCount — adaptive second-derivative outlier detector. A click manifests as a
    //    second derivative |s[i+1] - 2*s[i] + s[i-1]| that's anomalously large *relative to
    //    its recent typical value*. Smooth music has consistent (low) second-derivative
    //    energy. Bright music has consistent (medium) second-derivative energy. A click has
    //    *suddenly* much larger second-derivative energy than recent norm, regardless of
    //    overall content level.

    // discontinuity baseline." Plus an absolute floor so quiet-content noise doesn't trip it.
