    //   * trim drops      — smoothness-knob click-trim trimming the buffer toward target
    //   * drain drops     — one-shot drain when the user moves the latency slider
    //   * catastrophic    — TrimFromProducer when the buffer crosses the 1s safety cap

    // === Drift correction (Phase 4, 2026-05-14) — fixed-ratio resampler ===
    //
    // Replaces the Phase-2/3 discrete-splice drift corrector. Sender and receiver each have
    // their own free-running audio crystal and the two rates differ by a few-tens to a few-
    // hundreds of ppm. Without compensation the receive ring buffer slowly drifts up
    // (sender faster) or down (sender slower) and eventually clicks via either overflow or
    // underrun.
    //
    // Discrete single-frame drop / repeat splices — even with cosine crossfade and adaptive-
    // gain integrator scheduling — are audible at any drift rate above roughly 1 correction
    // per second on tonal content. Ed reported them as a continuous train of "tiny pops" all
    // through this session. The instrumentation added 2026-05-14 confirmed the corrector
    // was firing at 4-13 repeats/sec for his Audient EVO4 ↔ EVO8 setup (~150-200 ppm drift).
    //
    // The fixed-ratio resampler approach is what every serious networked-audio implementation
    // (Jamulus, SonoBus, Dante) uses for the same problem:
    //   1. Measure the sender's effective sample rate by comparing bytes written to the ring
    //      vs bytes output to the audio device over a long window (multi-second).
    //   2. Configure a WdlResampler with input rate = measured-sender-rate and output rate =
    //      MixSampleRate. The resampler continuously stretches or compresses the incoming
    //      stream by the necessary ppm.
    //   3. Update the resampler's input rate ONLY every DriftMeasurementWindowSec, smoothed
    //      heavily. The earlier doomed attempt (May) modulated rates per-sample based on
    //      instantaneous buffer level; that caused phase discontinuities and sample-level
    //      artefacts. Slow updates avoid that entirely.
    //
    // Pitch shift introduced by a fixed-ratio resampler at, say, 200 ppm is 0.02 % — far
    // below the ~5 % human pitch-discrimination threshold and even below tuning precision.
    // Genuinely inaudible.
    //
    // Safety net: the legacy click-trim block above stays in place and fires only at
    // catastrophic buffer levels (target + ~23 ms or 1 second worst-case cap). The discrete
    // splice corrector (drop / repeat with crossfade) is GONE — the resampler handles
    // steady-state drift smoothly. If the resampler somehow can't keep up (transient
    // catastrophe), the click-trim safety net fires once.
    //
    // The resampler. Output-driven (we want N output frames; ask the resampler how many
    // input frames it needs and feed those in from the ring buffer). interp=true with
    // filtercnt=0 selects WdlResampler's low-cost linear-interpolation mode — plenty good
    // enough for the ppm-scale rate corrections we apply. Higher filter modes would add
    // CPU cost for a sample quality difference well below audibility at these tiny ratios.

        // until packets refilled the buffer ALL THE WAY BACK to the user's target latency
        // and NoteFramesQueued re-armed. Each transient underrun became a 10-15ms silence
        // gap instead of a few-ms pad. That's the audible click that Ed kept hearing on
        // localhost at target=10 vs the older build that ran clean.
        //
        // Now: a momentary empty buffer just produces a small silence-pad on this Read (the
        // underrun counter still increments via playout.ReadFloats's own silence-fill — fine,
        // that's diagnostic noise not audio noise). The 4-second idle-prune in AudioReceiver
        // still handles long-term disconnect by tearing the session down entirely. No auto-
        // disarm needed.

        // === Click-based buffer-smoothness trim ===
        //
        // The Buffer-smoothness knob (1 = aggressive, 10 = smooth) controls how aggressively
        // we DROP oldest samples when the buffer drifts above target. When (bufferedMs >
        // target + trimMargin) we drop the excess down to target. Causes a brief click at the
        // drop point but holds the queue right at the user's chosen latency.
        //
        // Largely a safety net post-Phase 2: the drift corrector below keeps the buffer near
        // target in normal operation, so the trim only fires under catastrophic conditions
        // (large step changes the slow integrator can't keep up with). Replaced an earlier
        // resampler-rate controller that pitch-shifted music while correcting drift — clicks
        // turned out to be the lesser evil, and the trim itself is a direct DropOldest on the
        // ring buffer (no resampler involved), so it's guaranteed to fire when needed.
        //
        // Margin and drop-destination computation. SPLIT BY KNOB:
        //
        // smoothness == 1 ("stupid aggressive" — used in ASIO Tight Latency mode for
        // sub-10 ms target):
        //   floor       = largestWriteMs * 2 + 4 (min 4)
        //   drop-to     = target + largestWriteMs (one packet's cushion only)
        //   This is the original "reconnect-feel" tightness — tight threshold,
        //   tight drop, frequent clicks but glued to target. Don't touch this. It's
        //   what makes ASIO at target=1 ms snap back to target after every burst.
        //
        // smoothness >= 2:
        //   floor       = largestWriteMs * 4 + 4 (min 15)
        //   drop-to     = target + largestWriteMs * 2 + 5 (covers render-period +
        //                 frame + jitter pad)
        //   The looser values prevent default-smoothness-3 from tripping on routine
        //   startup bursts (96 kHz device + Opus 5 ms saw a 40 ms initial buffer that
        //   exceeded the old default threshold of 32 ms — the rate controller would
        //   have handled it in a few seconds, but trim fired and dropped the buffer
        //   too low to absorb normal sender jitter, causing 20 underruns/sec for the
        //   rest of the session).
        //
        // Direct evidence: localhost 96 kHz Opus test 2026-05-02 06:37 with
        // smoothness=3 — drops=9600 from one startup trim, then 20 underruns/sec.
        // Subsequent 48 kHz test with same smoothness ran clean because trim never
        // fired (buffer never quite reached the 32 ms threshold). The looser default
        // floor lets the rate controller handle initial transients on either device
        // rate.
        //
